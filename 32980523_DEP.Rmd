# FIT5147 \| Data Exploration Project

## 

> The objective is to provide an easy to follow framework for analysis that allows the analyst or PhD student to walk through their entire approach in a step-by-step manner with their colleagues or PhD supervisors.

> In each of the 6-steps, the researcher is to provide their code, outputs for the code, and any comments/thoughts that may help the reader interpret the approach that was taken.

## **Step 1: Research Question/Problem Statement**

1.  Research Question/Problem Statement #1

2.  Research Question/Problem Statement #2

##### **NOTES:**

Provide any additional thoughts around the research question

-   Hypothesis

-   Potential issues or challenges

-   Potential limitations

-   Etc.

## **Step 2: Data Collection/Measurement Strategy**

1.  Description of the Data

-   Data sources (database, websites, data collection, etc.)

The following steps will go through loading the data that will be used throughout the project.

-   Structure of the data

-   Data issues (missing data, messy data, etc.)

2.  Collection/Measurement

-   If data needs to be collected, what are the measurements being taken (clearly define the procedures and standardization)?

-   Are the measurements valid and reliable (is there potentially a need to add a research step here and conducting your own validity/reliability study before proceeding)?

3.  Data Cleaning

-   What pre-processing steps were taken?

-   Clearly walk through the data cleanning process.

-   Is any data missing, if so how much?

-   Describe any imputation process for missing data.

-   If any data was removed prior to analysis explain why.

## **Step 3: Visualize & Summarize Data**

-   Once data has been collected and cleaned, provide an overview of the data using summarize statistics and visuals.

-   Offer interpretation of visuals that may help guide the model building process or generate discussion about any underlying trends in the data specific to the research question.

## **Step 4: Model Development/Interpretation**

-   Iteratively build models (simple to complex).

-   Interpret the results of each model to explain why a more complex model or different modelling strategy may be required.

## **Step 5: Model Evaluation**

-   Evaluation the final model(s), describing model errors, model accuracy, residuals, assumptions, etc.

## **Step 6: Communication of Results**

-   Communicate the results of the final model(s) in a clear manner using visualizations and language that is understandable to the end user.

-   Explain whether or not the research question has been answered.

-   Clearly discuss any limitations of the analysis.

-   Offer suggestions for future analysis or perhaps other data sets that may be incorporated to provide a more contextual answer to the research question.
